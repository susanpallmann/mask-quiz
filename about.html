            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              This website is a reaction to the events taking place around us today in the wake of COVID-19. Faced with a pandemic that 
              limits career options and creative spaces, it has been a challenge and personal mission to find ways to keep creating. 
              However, this unparalleled time also creates unique opportunities. There has arguably never been a better time to be creating 
              websites than in a time where many are 'stuck' at home on the internet. And in the absence of paid opportunities but in 
              abundance of time, there has rarely been better motivation to develop web campaigns for causes that need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although many are still taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, there have also been recent efforts to return to 
              normal too soon, with many people abandoning caution in the name of comfort. Although cases continue to increase in many 
              places, people are ignoring social distancing, congregating in public spaces, and not wearing masks. Public health is a public 
              responsibility, and to make a large-scale impact on the virus will take a large-scale effort on the part of each person.
            </p>
            <p>So please, if you're going out around other people, <em>wear your dang mask</em>.

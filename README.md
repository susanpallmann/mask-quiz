A quiz to help you figure out if you should wear a mask during the pandemic!

## Concept
This project started as more of a joke, but the message is still a good one. Wear Your Dang Mask is a mini-website featuring a quiz that asks about some common concerns surrounding wearing a mask to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, regardless of what one answers on the quiz, the answer is always yes, you should wear a mask.

## Development Efforts
Despite the short nature of this project, a lot of extra effort went into making this website accessibile and cross-browser compatible.

### Accessibility
Some of the ways this website is made accessibile:
* tabindex settings
* aria roles & states
* return & space key support
